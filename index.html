										<h2>Interesting Fact</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I have taken up exercising as a hobby since the first lock down.
											 Before then, I was 143kgs and was not taking excellent care of my health, since then I have lost over 65kgs.
											 It has made a huge impact on my physical and mental health.
											 Exercise as a medium to work through stress has been an incredible adventure and I have never felt healthier.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<h2>My Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>My interests in IT are quite varied and have changed a lot over my life.
									 As I assume would be similar for others in this course, my early childhood was shaped by technology.
										My father would bring home old computers from his work that were being replaced and I would then take them, replace parts and have my own computer set-up.
										 To be completely honest I would break a number of them trying to pry computer parts from their motherboards, especially the giant copper heat sinks.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>As of the last few years my passions have extended into the psycho-social aspect of technology in our lives. IT is a major part of the 21st century, our lives and experiences are shaped greatly by the technology we use. I want to understand its impacts and work towards using it to improve the lives of everyone. Us as humans are shaped by the tools we use, we experience the world through the lenses of our technology. Social media platforms have the power to shape our psychology to a surreal extent, our world views and experiences are influenced by our interactions and more of humanity is using the internet to interact with the world than ever before. I would like to see it become completely transparent about how it influences its users, and eventually become a place where we can experience existence from every persons perspective.</p>

							<h2>Interest in IT Continued</h2>
								</header>
							<p>My brother-in-law is a software engineer and learnt at Melbourne Uni. I was talking to him about getting a degree and he highly recommended going to RMIT. His experience was that the people who got degrees from RMIT were ahead of him in regards to practical use of their skills and it took him a couple of months to catch up to them in the work place. After learning this I applied through OUA and am planning to get a degree in software engineering when I have the opportunity to do so. What I am expecting to learn through RMIT are the tools I can use to become a successful software engineer in the future and how to use them when my studies have been completed. I’m very excited by this aspect as  I already have learnt a lot from my short time in this course.</p>

								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
								<p>The requirements for the job are quite accommodating for potential employees. With the freedom to use qualifications (such as a degree) or relevant practical experience you can apply for a job without formal education if you posses the skills needed. The other requirements are at least two years experience with one programming language and two years experience with data structures or algorithms.
									<br />
									<br />
									Currently I possess qualifications in media, design and auto-mechanical work. I don’t believe my current training would be too useful for this role, however, it is a part of what has lead me to where I am now and I am grateful for the knowledge I have developed.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>My plan to reach this goal are to start with finish the two subjects I am doing at this time.
										 Either I will change into the degree in software engineering when these subjects are done,
										  or when I have gone through one year in the degree in IT. Once I have received my degree,
											 I have the choice of doing a masters in computer science, or working at a tech startup to build my skills and experience working as a software engineer.
											  When I have completed the needed amount of experience in this role I will apply for the role I wish to be in.</p>

								<p>The results of these personality/psychometric tests show a correlation in their data.
According to my results, I am a brave, charismatic person who likes helping others achieve their goals and ambitions. It also indicates that I have a strong moral sense (which I 100% agree with) which drives the decisions I make on a day to day basis. The results that say I am most likely to speak out against what I believe is wrong or immoral is true, I am not afraid of calling out injustice and righting the wrong that has been made. One of my prior roles was as an insurance specialist working with customers, in that role I had an excellent customer satisfaction level due to my drive to put all my effort in with every customer, and work together with angry/disgruntled customers and their complaints through resolutions that make them feel understood and valued.

									<p>When it comes to working with a team I believe that my results indicate my love of interacting with my colleges, being a part of a team and striving to improve our professional standing by working together. I think the key with happiness and job satisfaction truly comes with the connections we form when working with others, by making this enjoyable and beneficial for every member we will love coming to work and doing an excellent job.
										<br />
											<br />
										When it comes to forming a team I believe it would be useful for myself to be grouped with people who need a bit of support and help, where I can give them my knowledge and advice.

									<h3>Project Objective</h3>
									<p>The learning barrier for new people to crafts to know how they should start and proceed isn’t too high for the most part. However, when starting a new skill those first steps are daunting to anyone who wishes to begin the journey of learning in any form. This website will be able to address peoples curiosities towards crafting with ideas they may be interested in with instructions on how to make these items. The goal of the project is to build a site that can be the start of someones crafting journey. This will be done by generating randomly selected craft projects that can be done at home.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-comment"></span>
									<h3>My Motivation</h3>
									<p>I have always enjoyed finding new do it yourself projects to do at home, and I see a lot of people searching for something that they can be proud of. The enjoyment of making anything yourself is fulfilling, you don’t just gain a new item but a new perspective on every object around you. You develop a new appreciation for the material items you poses. The entire process of crafting is special, you’re putting your passion into the creation of something new, and in my opinion that is the epitome of art and self-expression. If this project can assist others in finding their passions, it can be a part of making society a better place through self-development and creativity.</p>

								<section class="col-4 col-6-medium col-12-xsmall">
									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-flask"></span>
									<h3>Tell Me More!</h3>
									<p>The website address will be “https://www.doityourselferator.com”, this will be the hub for do-it-yourself projects anyone can start regardless of skill level. I have chosen this name as I see the product provided to be a generator of inspiration for the users who visit. When you arrive on the home page you will be greeted by a minimalist designed theme that makes the user feel comfortable. Personally I believe the design choice is one of the bigger focuses for this project. Many websites these days have too much information and options for the user from the first page, it’s overwhelming and unfriendly for a new visitor to navigate and find what they want. By simplifying the options presented we can make the users feel like the website is a safe, inviting place to explore. </p>

									<span class="icon solid alt major fa-paper-plane"></span>
									<h3>"You like style?" - Barry Bee</h3>
									<p>The style also supports the functionality of the website. As the reason for the site to exist is to inspire creativity through project ideas it needs to present the information in an easy to digest way. We can do that through making most of the visible space on the screen dedicated to presenting the projects and buttons to cycle through new ones until the user finds something that peaks their interest. The cycle function should be fluid and easy to use, we can use a well designed function built in that allows the website to pre-load a set number of projects as alternatives before the cycle option has been selected. This will allow the user to feel like the website is responding as quickly as possible to their requests. We don’t need to worry about load times for the main page when first opened due to all other features on the page being as simple as possible, and therefore less data required to load all assets. Functionality as a feature I believe has become a huge factor for any website competing in the last 5 years of IT from the users perspective.</p>

									<h3>But Wait... There's More!</h3>
									<p>We are getting more and more used to everything working “as it should” as soon as we start any piece of software, and this project will be very focused on user experience as something we give to every person who adventures into this website. One of the hurdles we will face within this project will be incorporating the projects themselves into the website display function. Though I posses numerous books of projects myself that are free to be used as options on this website, I worry that it won’t be enough looking into the future. If we are to build a piece of software that can scour the internet for ideas, convert them into a form that the website will present to the user I can see a level of longevity for new ideas to present to the user base.
										Long term I see the website being incredibly popular, current trends from Generation Z are leaning heavily into the idea of self expression and discovery. Though the website will be accessible to any age range, the audience I think it will connect to heavily will be the younger generations. I personally discovered my passion for these creative works through the internet as a young teen, and when your education about a lot of the world comes through the internet, we can teach people things they wouldn’t get to experience through normal streams of learning.

									<h3>Tools!?!</h3>
									<p>From the tools and technologies perspective there is only a few major pieces of technology to develop for this project to excel. High level web design is possible with many tools, we will use Atom and Sublime for creation of the website to achieve the ambitions set. The programs to data grab and organise do-it-yourself projects will also be built using the last two suggested text editors. I see this to be a challenge but not something to be concerned about from the start, as this will take a considerable amount of time compared to the rest of the project to be developed and featured. Lastly we will use a host platform for the website with an excellent track record for up time, while also giving us the options to increase bandwidth with ease as the user base grows.</p>
									<br/>
									<br/>
									<h3>Le Skille, What the Hell is That!?!</h3>
									<p>An excellent level of skill in web design, eventually having a full time web developer would be optimal as they could continually work on making the project as advanced and up to date with the ever changing internet landscape. We also will need the skills in developing a web crawler and data conversion tool that would allow the website to keep adding new projects throughout operation. These positions we will need people who are skilled in HTML for the web design side of the project. As for building the pieces of software needed for obtaining and converting data, Python is an excellent language for building this software.</p>

							<h2>And what will the outcome be?</h2>
							<p>The outcome we are aiming to achieve with this project is a website that gives its users the  knowledge and inspiration to build creative projects that are brought to them through the intuitive web design. By setting the goal of this project to lower and potentially remove the first hurdle into do-it-yourself projects I hope that it inspires a larger community of people who can embrace their inner artistic side and explore the human ability of creation. Broadly speaking, I want this project to be about enabling others to discover a new part of themselves, a part that makes us both proud of what we have, and can achieve. It’s lofty in its ambitiousness, but I think ideas that create real positive changes in our communities are always going to start in small obscure ways.
